*We build Performing Apps for brands. The proliferation of mobile culture is transforming the web and mobile is now at the centre of brand strategies. Premier brands rely on us.*

> During my time at **Droiders**, I transitioned from an intern to a full-time iOS engineer — building my first production apps, learning the fundamentals of iOS development, and exploring real-time communication with **XMPP**.  
>  
> This is a reflection on those early years — the projects, challenges, and collaborations that sparked my passion for mobile development and shaped the foundation of my engineering career.


## Starting My iOS Journey at Droiders

When I joined **Droiders as an iOS Intern**, the company was a small agency located within the university campus — the perfect environment to begin a career surrounded by brilliant academic minds just out of school.  

This was my **first real contact with iOS and mobile development**. I joined the team to help build **Dovespot**, a social network application connecting people with shared interests.

My first contribution was to **design and implement a caching system** for profile pictures displayed within the app.  
The solution proved reliable and efficient, earning me the **trust of the team** and marking the beginning of what would become an incredibly formative experience.

## From Intern to iOS Engineer

After the success of **Dovespot**, I earned a **permanent position** at Droiders and was assigned to a more ambitious project: building a **secure messaging platform** based on the **XMPP protocol**.  

I worked closely with [Pedro Vicente](https://github.com/pedrovgs), one of the most talented engineers I’ve met, to define **custom XMPP extensions** enabling secure and feature-rich communication between clients.  

I developed the iOS app **from scratch**, ensuring it worked seamlessly across both iPhone and iPad — this became my **first commercial iOS application: Enjoystr**.

## Learning the Craft

During my time at Droiders, I learned the **complete iOS development cycle** — from UI design to network communication and deployment.  
Working with **XMPP** gave me deep insights into **real-time messaging**, **protocol design**, and **secure client communication**.  

It was a hands-on crash course in **building production-ready apps** while collaborating with a small but passionate team of engineers and designers.

This experience was more than a first job — it was the **foundation of my iOS career**.  


> 💬 **Final note:**  
> My time at Droiders gave me not only my first commercial iOS app, but also **lifelong friendships and mentors** who continue to inspire me today.
